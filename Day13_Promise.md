# Day 13: Promise (TW: violence)
“Promise me,” you said, mere hours after you shot Mom in the head, “promise that you’ll take me out if I ever start turning into one of those things.” 
I nodded then, even if I didn’t truly understand, and it’s weighed on me ever since. I figured it couldn’t happen, that I’d be dead long before you. You were my big brother, after all. You always knew what to do. I’ve asked myself what would you do now, if it were me. Maybe you’d keep me chained in the basement too, listening to my pained groaning for days. Stalling. No, you wouldn’t have waited this long. It wasn’t right for me to wait this long. 
Dad’s old 9mm trembled in my hand as I sat in a dining chair at the top of the stairs. Another one of your agonizing moans echoed from the open door. “Fuck,” I whispered viciously. My leg bounced in panic. Tears dropped from my chin. “Fuck!” 
Snatching the near empty bottle of cheap vodka at my feet, I took a stinging swig and wiped my lips with my sleeve to hold back the urge to vomit. Gasping, I slowly put the bottle back, rose from the chair with a wooden creak, and descended the dust covered basement staircase into the stench of death.
You were in the corner, chained at the neck like a rabid animal to a support beam. Pillows, bottles, wrappers and empty cans littered the space around you. Our favorite blanket as kids was draped over your legs and covered in bloody crust and black ooze. The bandages around your forearm were soaked through. 
I approached with the gun. Your face looked so much worse than yesterday. Darkness pulsed through your neck and creeped up the veins in your cheeks. Your eyes were already starting to gloss and cloud. For a moment, I thought it might have been too late, until you spoke. “Danny.” 
My mouth fell agape. I stopped in my tracks. You were still here. “Jacob?” 
You took in a rattling wheeze. “Do it, Danny.”
Another wave writhed your body. You gritted your teeth and squeezed your eyes closed. When you reopened them, they drifted around the room blindly. Tugging against the chains at your neck, a horrible choking noise gurgled from your throat. 
My face seeped, and I raised the gun with both hands to point between your eyes. What would I do after you were gone? Every time I thought that far ahead, I was drowned in overwhelming dread. So overwhelming, I’d spend minutes with the gun shaking against my own head. I’d lowered it, thinking about you downstairs. Thinking about our promise. 
“Danny,” you said in a hoarse rasp. You’d come back again, but I didn’t know for how long. “Do it now. While I’m still me.”
“I can’t,” I said in a sob, still gripping the gun fiercely.
“Do you,”—you coughed something wet—“do you love me?”
Wincing, I bobbed my head. “Yes.” 
“Do it out of love.” You closed your eyes and thudded your head back against the support. I took a step forward. The gun was heavier than ever. My finger curled over the trigger. I wanted to close my eyes too. Keeping you trapped for as long as I have has picked at my heart over and over like an old scab. 
I wanted it done. I'd rather die than do it. But in the end you were right. This was out of love. Why were you always right… 
“I love you, Danny,” you whispered, as I pulled in the trigger.
