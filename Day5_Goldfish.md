# Day 5: Goldfish
Over canyon creek, I leapt desperately with little legs, misstepped, and tumbled. Behind me, the creatures scurried down the rock scree in pursuit, crossing cavernous terrain on all fours. “Sammy,” I squealed and scrambled back. “Sammy, help me!”  
Scaling the creek, red eyes jounced in the shadows. One lunged and bit my shoe. I yelped as it thrashed, yanking it off my foot. Another came forward gnashing its teeth, but hesitated when an orange light emanated from the exit. The golden glow of his scales lit the cavern like a beacon. His giant fish belly flew overhead, weightless fins like sails whipping at the air in a defensive charge. The creatures retreated to the shadows at the sight of him. Once safe, Sammy looked back with his bulbous eyes. I met his adoring gaze for a moment before he opened his mouth, and the ring of my workday alarm came out.
Peeling my eyes open, I hastily reached over my nightstand to shut it off, hand brushing across the tabletop aquarium. Sammy was there, as expected. His ten year old body wiggled as he swam against the filter. I smiled at him. “Thanks, Sammy.”
