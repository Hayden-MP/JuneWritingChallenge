# Day 11: Uncanny Beauty (TW: violence and sexual themes)
I wish I’d never seen it while browsing through my neighbors estate sale. I don’t even like art, but it beckoned me. After paying the lady five dollars, I left her driveway with the statuette tucked in my arm as if it were a newborn. 
“What is that?” my vulture of a wife asked from the couch as I came inside our house.
I scanned the living room for a proper place. “It’s a statue.”
“Whatever happened to no frivolous purchases?”
Pushing aside the family portrait in the center of the fireplace mantel, I replaced it with the statuette. “It was only five bucks.” 
I took a step back to admire it: a ceramic female figure, her body draped in translucent lace. She arched her back over the curve of a mossy boulder, and peered upside down through eyes as deep as the ocean. Stretched over her head, one of her hands tempted me hither. She was captivating. My wife appeared beside me, her arms furled. “So weird.”
It scared me at first, but I dreamt of her every night after that. I’d wake to her siren’s song and find her animated on the mantel, beckoning me with her outstretched hand. Unable to stop myself, I came to pick up her supple body; small in the hands of a salivating giant. I could easily crush her in my fist, but instead I swallowed every inch of her.
Guilt gnawed at me during the day. The wife grew suspicious the second time I rejected her affection. “You’ve been acting like this ever since you got that damn statue,” she would say, laying naked on top of me. “You need to get rid of it tomorrow.” 
But she didn’t know what she was asking. Waking life was hollow. Powerless, I sat in a cubicle processing insurance claims of people who blamed me for their problems, drove home in a car I couldn't afford, back to a wife that neutered me. 
Only to appease her, I agreed to throw it away. She watched from the kitchen window that morning as I took the statue to the garbage bin. After a satisfactory nod, she left, and the day went on. 
The thought of it surrounded by trash knotted my stomach at work. I couldn’t focus, so I used an hour of sick time and came home early. 
I ran to the bin the second I parked and fished her out. I wiped her down with my shirt. Her deep eyes promised me something that night.
I tossed and turned in bed, listening intently for her song. When it came, she led me back to the shed. Hidden under a tarp, she was laying on her back in invitation. Starving with an insatiable appetite, I picked her up and indulged. 
My wife jarred me awake with the lightswitch and a shout, “What the hell are you doing?”
Pulling back the cold, rigid statue from my face, I turned to my wife in shock. “I wasn’t… This isn’t what it looks like.”
She stomped forward. “Give me that,” she said, but I held my arm out to keep her back. She reached. I jerked away. “This has gone on long enough. You have to destroy it.”
“I can’t destroy it. Are you crazy?”
Her face contorted. “You calling me crazy? You’re choosing a statue over me. Your own wife!” 
I didn’t know what to say. This past week I’d felt more alive than ever. Was this what crazy felt like, and what was more, did I like it? “Destroy it now,” my wife said. “Destroy it, or I’m leaving. Do you understand me? I will leave you.”
Lowering my arm in resignation, my eyes trailed back to the statue in a trance. My wife saw her chance and snatched it from my grip. I shouted and lunged. She stumbled backward, her heel catching the top of the lawnmower. I managed to grab the statue before she fell and hit the back of her head on a stack of cinder blocks. The single lightbulb swayed from the scuffle, revealing the slow drain of red pooling onto the floor. She twitched once then went still.
Panic rose inside me. My skin clammed up. “Oh, no,” I said out loud. “What have I… what did I…” Lightheaded and flooded with nausea, sweat dotted my forehead as thoughts whirled inside my skull with the sway of the light. Was she dead? What should I do if she was? I had to check her pulse. Or, do I call someone? The police? They would think it was me. Was it me?
Paralyzed, my body froze in place. Squirming in my palm, I brought her up, the statuette, and she gazed into me with a subtle grin. Her body relaxed and exposed, limbs sprawled over my hand. She lazily lifted her arm and flicked in her small fingers, beckoning. 
My heart raced as I brought her to my lips.
