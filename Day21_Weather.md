# Day 21: Weather
Each tick of the analog wall clock made Terra flinch. The closer it reached three, the sharper the sound. There wasn’t a way to tell time without it, not with the thing glitching all her electronics. So, she sat stiffly on the motel room bed, boots laced and coat dawned, and exchanged nervous glances between the closet door and the clock. 
Tick. She tensed. Tock. 
Coming to her feet a second before three, she stepped forward to open the closet. On the ground, the helmet-sized object was wrapped with cloth. She carefully picked it up. Dense and heavy, struggling to keep it away from her torso, she left for her old truck parked outside. 
Peeling out of the lot, she followed the wooded backroads on the outskirts of her hometown, to a place found on no map. The way only known by her and a handful of childhood friends, now all deceased, all but her. 
The unassuming telephone pole marked the overgrown entrance, and she pulled off the highway and over gravel to follow the path. She drove as far as her tires could take her. Stomach souring each time she checked the wrapped object on her passenger seat, her act to do this was never from courage, but of desperation. 
Parking at the end of the trail, she leapt out and came around the hood to the passenger side, opened the steel door with a rusty creak, and faced the object on the seat. Timidly, she reached out to pull the knot keeping the wrap together. Pulling away layer by layer, she got to the last veil, and sucked in a breath. She lifted it, revealing the massive humanoid skull staring at her with empty sockets. Its goat horns protruded and curled back from the forehead, with rows of its sharp teeth layered in a pointed grimace. 
As Terra studied it, the atmosphere dimmed around her. In the sky above her, a dark cloud emerged from the overcast. She pulled her hood over her head as a brisk wind blew across her face, then took the skull hastily into her arms. 
She followed the unkempt footpath, riddled in weeds and dead leaves that rose into the air with each of her footsteps. Despair, regret, the mysterious illnesses, the impossible accidents, she was ending it now, once and for all. Outstretched branches shaking in the welter gave way to the clearing. It was just how she remembered it twenty years ago. The dark, dead willow tree knotted and twisted in the center, surrounded by short lush grass. Even the mushrooms hadn’t changed as they circled through the midden. 
She approached with the skull as the sky darkened further. The two smaller horned skulls laid staggered on each of their respective positions at the base of the trunk. It took her years to find them all. Autumn leaves clattered in the surrounding trees as she checked her analog wristwatch. Time ticked closer to three-thirty-three, and the bone in her hands began to vibrate. It was almost time. It was almost over. 
Tick. She tensed. Tock. The skull trembled.
Three-thirty-three, and she leaned down to position the skull in its final resting place, the highest position among the others, the patriarch. And as she stepped back, the wind died to a whisper, and color came back to the field. Sunlight peered through the fading clouds, revealing the blue of the sky. Harmonized, her burden lifted, as did the souls of her friends.
