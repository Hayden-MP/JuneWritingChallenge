# Day 9: Isolation
You walked through the front door at 3AM; I knew, because I was lying awake in bed. Peeling back the comforter, I stumbled into the dim hall as you were slipping off your heels. Once, you looked at me, then turned to rummage fastidiously through your purse on the counter. You didn’t hear me coming up behind you. Reaching into your pockets, you paused as my arms slid around your torso, and gently pulled you in with my chin on your shoulder. I didn’t bother asking where you’d been. I couldn’t bear another lie. My grip loosened as you came to face me, vacantly. Those bright eyes once envisaged a life of promise and future. Now, I stared at a corpse, and realized how futile it was to fight this alone.
