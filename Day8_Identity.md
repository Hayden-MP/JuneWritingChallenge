# Day 8: Identity
“Come out,” said the Figure, silhouetted against the daylit entrance of the barn. Silence swept the dust inside, and the Figure stepped forward. “I know you’re here. Come out,” he said, turning toward raspy breaths from behind a stack of crates. “You do not need to hide.”
“No!” squealed the Being, and scurried spasmodically to the far side of the room, tipping over the stack. Masks made of a variety of lesser materials spilled out, some turned to pieces on the ground. 
Stooping, the Figure inspected a crude, gilt canvas mask and turned it over in his hands. “These are not needed.”
Hidden, the Being looked on. “You would say that. Yours of quality brings you privilege.”
The Figure touched his porcelain face with his fingertips, then gently released the canvas mask and stood. “Privilege. It serves me, but it does not define my Being.”
The Being scoffed. “It matters little. Such things are of no relevance to the World. There is no place for me.”
The Figure stared at the masks at his feet. “I am ever changing, yet the mask remains the same. To be isolated from the World is lonesome, to be isolated whilst surrounded by many masks is lonesome still.” The Being peered through a crack between crates as the Figure reached to unveil his face. “In a World of many masks, the only privilege is in meeting another Being.”
