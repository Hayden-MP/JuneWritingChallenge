# Day 28: Numb (TW: gore)
Decrepit remains of the mine shaft emerged from a foggy atmosphere of ice. Up the steep incline which had them slipping in their tracks, snowflakes fell across their path in speeding lines. The townsmen were weary. Crude polearms and shields sagged in their numb and blistered hands. Coming to this place with collective heart, morale waned with each frostbitten breath. 
“We’re nearly there,” yelled the head of the abject militia. “Remember why we came here, men. For our wives, sons, and daughters.” He huffed with each step, and stopped short of the mine’s entrance. “No longer will we cower in our homes while this accursed menace plagues our town. No longer will we wake to find another one of ours taken in the night. We end this, for once and for all. Ready yourselves, and follow me into the pits of evil so we may cleanse the land of its filth. For Rorsund!”
Warmth spread through them. The men raised their weapons in a cheer, “For Rorsund!”
With newfound courage, they charged through the darkness in a desperate uproar and crossed the threshold. Outside light dwindled in the shadows, and they could not see the source of the crunching beneath their snow-coated boots. They came with oil soaked torches, and sparked one aflame. 
Silence befell the room as they took in the sight of the orange-flickering space. One man whimpered, another weeped. Severed body parts littered the ground, frozen blood splattered the walls. Heads of children, their mouths open and tongues black, stared at them with empty eye sockets. 
Unrest swept over the men, and a wafty bellow came from further down the shaft. Many of them abandoned the scene, scurrying out with their tail between their legs and tears crystalizing to their lashes. The leader stood still, looked deep into the dark, and froze in place as a pale face spanning the size of the cavern moved toward him in a steady glide. Its sclerotic eyes peeled open and rolled with a numerous collection of irises and pupils of different shades and shapes. 
He screamed as the face opened its jagged maw and lurched.
