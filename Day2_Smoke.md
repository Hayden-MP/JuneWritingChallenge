# Day 2: Smoke
Sunlight melted over the horizon and bathed their skin in gold. He took a  pack from his jacket, and from it, brandished a minted white and orange banded cigarette.
“I didn’t know you smoked.”
Halted in the middle of a decades-gone routine, he glanced at her. “Not like they got ‘em at Minor.” He bit the filter and went to close the pack, but hesitated and tipped the box toward her. “You want one?” She stared at it pensively, and mumbled something indiscernible. “One won’t kill ya.”
She shot him a look with a sardonic smirk. “Isn’t that what everyone says when trying to get someone hooked on something?” 
He kept their gaze steady as if challenged, and scoffed. “You got me. I’m trying to get you hooked on cigarettes. That was the plan all along. Turn you into a smoker chick,”—he paused and narrowed his eyes—“why you smiling at me like that?”
