# Day 29: Trickling Creek (TW: violence)
Sunlight glimmered across the ripples of the shallow creek, and she dove in with a plastic thermos. Pulling it into her chest, she gazed into the cloudy water at all the little black bulbs wicking their tails. She’d bring them home, despite her father’s warnings. She always wanted frogs. 
Capping and sliding the thermos into her pink school bag, she slipped over the seat of her bicycle. Mylar frills sprouting from the handlebar grips flapped spasmodically in the wind, whipping around like tadpole tails. She pedaled even harder toward her house at the end of the street.
Parking her bike on the side of the house, she snuck around to the backyard sliding glass door, and peered inside. No one in sight. Carefully, she slipped through and closed it as quietly as she could behind her. 
The frogs needed a home, she thought. Searching through the cabinets, she found a cylindrical glass vase that she’d seen her mother use for flowers sometimes. She snatched it, then stepped up on the footstool to put it in the sink and under the faucet. Taking one last nervous, cursory glance around her, she opened the valve and watched the vase fill with tap water. 
Tiptoeing to the base of the stairs, water sloshing in her arms, her mother with her baby brother inside her big tummy rounded the corner. “Lily,” she said, looking down and furrowing her brow. “What are you doing with that?”
“It’s for flowers,” Lily said, hurriedly and rehearsed. “I’m going to pick flowers.”
“You are bringing it to your room?” Lily nodded. Her mother leaned and reached for it. “You are gonna drop it on the stairs. Here, I’ll take it. Go on.”
Lilly pounced up the steps, giddy with excitement at the thought of having little frogs. Her mother placed the vase on her dresser and left. Once the coast was clear, she sneakily unzipped her backpack and uncapped the thermos. 
Her heart sank. All the tadpoles were gone except for one that floated listlessly on top of the water. At least she could have one frog, she thought, and stretched her arm over the opening of the vase and poured in the contents of the thermos. Watching the black spot fall and float, she realized it didn’t have a tail like the others, and she wondered whether it was a tadpole at all. 

The rest of the day she spent clipping fresh flowers outside. She arranged them in the vase to hide her new pet. After dinner, a family movie, and the toothbrush dance with Mom, she was tucked in and kissed goodnight. 
Her mother pointed at the vase before flipping the lightswitch. “Beautiful flowers, Lily!”   
Lily smiled sleepily. “Thank you, Mommy. I love you.”
“I love you too. Goodnight.”
The room went dark. Her night light at the base of the bed cast an ensemble of dolphins onto the wall. Lily blinked slowly, and drifted away.
Tink.
Her eyes opened for a moment, then fluttered closed again.
Tink. Tink. Tink.
Shaken awake, she sat up in her bed. It sounded like glass. Looking across her dim moonlit bedroom, she stared at the vase and waited for sound.
Tink.
Throwing the comforter off her lap, she scurried to her dresser and scrutinized the glass. She grasped the flowers to pull them out for a better look. Dried and withered petals broke and flaked to pieces on the floor. They were fresh yesterday, Lily thought. How did they die so fast?
With the crumbing bouquet in her hand, she looked for the tadpole in the empty water. Even with the illumination of the moon outside her bedroom window, she couldn’t see it.
Tickling touched her fingers. She brought her hand down to see the tadpole was sticking to her hand, and it had grown legs. Well, they looked like legs, Lily surmised. It moved like a rollie pollie, but the way it moved was more of a stretch, cling, and drag. 
It reached the back of her hand and stopped, then splayed its legs out in a star, and a sudden pain stabbed through her skin. Lily squealed and stomped her feet in a panic. She threw the flowers to the ground and swiped at the back of her hand. It dug deeper. Blood swelled and dripped down her wrist. 
Her door swung open and the bedroom light came on. “What is going on in here?” her mother’s voice came from the doorway. Instantly, the creature retracted its legs and rolled to the ground. Lily leapt and cried hoarsely into her mothers legs. “Lily, what happened?”
“It bit me! It bit me!” 
“What bit you? Where?”
She gasped for air. “On my hand,” Lily said, blubbering and raising her hand to her mother. In the light, a small puncture wound was actively oozing blood streaked with black, with smaller red marks circling around it.
“Hey,” her father said, coming up behind her mother’s back. “Everything okay in here?”
“Look at this,” her mother said with concern in her tone. 
She stepped aside with Lily’s hand still in her grip. Her father blinked, squinted, then slid his glasses over his nose. Leaning over, he studied it closely, and his face dropped. “Lily. Did you go to the creek?” Lily’s weeping subsided for a moment and she nodded, guiltily. “Emergency room,” he said, coldly. “I’ll get the keys.”
