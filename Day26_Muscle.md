# Day 26: Muscle
The tip of my charcoal pencil slid over the paper, over hills and folds of the beautiful nude man who flexed his back on stage. The other students focused intently on their easels, but I couldn’t look away. Perhaps he knew, because he more than once caught my gaze from his various positions. I darted my eyes back to my pad, hiding behind it as if I'd committed a crime by admiring another man. Blushing, I trailed his rhomboids, down his erectors, then his glutes. Shading the terminator line of each bulge, ensuring each got their fair dose of bounced light to bring out the form. Everyone around me looked so professional and focused. I struggled.
“Time,” the instructor said off-stage, and everyone lowered their pencils unanimously. The model relaxed, then stooped down to pick up his clothes. 
The instructor came around to check each piece, starting with the end of the row. “Good,” he said. “You may go.” He moved on to the next as the student began packing their supplies.
He made his way down one by one, satisfactorily excusing each student for the day. Then, he came to mine, and paused. Putting his elbow in his hand, he raised an eyebrow. “You managed to only draw the muscle groups, but not the whole figure?”
“Not often we get someone so…” I glanced up at the model. He was looking down at me as he pulled his knit sweater over his firm abdominals. Blinking, I shook my head. “So, uh. Muscular.” I cleared my throat and pretended my work was intentional. This session was twenty percent of my grade, after all. “I took advantage of that here.”
The instructor nodded. “I suppose it suffices. Though next time I’d like to see the pose of the whole figure. It would give more context to the flexion of the muscles.” He nodded. “Good enough. You may go.”
I released a sigh of relief and flipped over the cover of my drawing pad, then leaned to reach for my art bag on the floor. When I lifted it to the stool, the model appeared in front of me. I nearly flinched. “Hey,” he said, smiling wide. A perfect smile.
“Oh,” I said casually, like his presence didn’t make me sweat. Be cool, Rowan. I continued dropping supplies in my bag. “Hey.”
“I’m Theo,” he said, and held out his hand. Oh no, I’m sweating. 
Switching my pencils between hands, I quickly wiped my wet palm on my shirt, and left a fingered trail of charcoal dust. Shit, why did I wear a white shirt today? I pretended like it didn’t bother me, and reached out to shake his hand. “I’m Rowan.” 
He squinted at my shirt but said nothing, then tilted his head to my drawing pad still propped up on the easel. “Mind if I look?”
