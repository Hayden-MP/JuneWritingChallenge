# Day 7: Sacrifice
Her tenth birthday. My little girl reached double digits. After picking up extra shifts at the bistro and closing the bar over the past few weekends, I scraped up enough for her gift: a night at the safari park, beside the elephants—her favorite. I thought it’d be an escape for me too, but as we sat within the view of a rural North County, her face was instead buried in her tablet. “Look, Al,” I urged her for the umpteenth time. “The elephants are coming around again.” She glanced up reproachfully, then slunk into her seat resumed prodding her screen. Tap, tap, tap.
I wanted to snatch and break it over my knee. The money should have been saved for the credit cards, or the car's engine light. I wanted to blame her. Yell at her: Look at all I’ve done for you. Can’t you see I’m bleeding? But it was her birthday, so I brooked her disinterest and watched as mother and baby elephant tenderly twined their trunks.
