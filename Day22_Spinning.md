# Day 22: Spinning
Fabrics rolled in a clockwise motion, and with ten minutes left to dry, I figured I could do the dishes. At the sink, I rinsed and scrubbed all the old grime that crusted to my dinnerware. This past week has been hard. Everything was neglected around this place. With the last dish dripping in the dishwasher, I shut it and went back out to the garage thinking it'd surely been ten minutes. But the clothes were still spinning. The screen said five minutes. I could water the plants in five minutes. 
Filling the watering can from the faucet, I went around to the plants indoor and out, and came to my peace lily with a couple bright yellow leaves. Bright yellow? Nervously, I pulled out my phone to research the cause. This peace lily was a gift from my lover, and so far lived as long as our entire relationship. I sat in the chair beside it, searching, searching. Article after article pointed to no definitive cause. And before I realized it, the light in the room was dim, and Iâ€™d been sitting here for an hour. I nearly threw my phone before leaping to my feet to run to the drier, where my clothes sat cold and wrinkled.
