Tapping, hissing, and a blaring horn, incessant as a morning alarm. He awoke to the sharp scent of gasoline from behind the steering wheel. Warm copper flooded his tongue as he raised his throbbing head to look through the dripping cobweb of his windshield. A cliffside boulder caught his truck by crumpling the hood before he cascaded into a valley of oblivion. It wasn’t there before. He should have died. 
Rockface blocking his door, he shambled out the passenger side onto a muddy hummock. Violent winds sprayed him with cold rain. Clothes sticking to his skin, he limped to the edge. “What am I?” A lightning bolt flashed from a distant cloud. He shouted ruefully into the rain, “What am I?!”
Thunder cracked, and the storm whispered, “You cannot know.”
