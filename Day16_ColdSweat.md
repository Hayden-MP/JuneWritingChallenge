# Day 16: Cold Sweat
Two in the morning, and someone was still watching television downstairs. They must have fallen asleep with it on, Laila thought, as she stared at the digital clock across her bedroom with weary eyes. Her insomnia was getting the best of her. Exhaustion weighed her body yet her mind would not let her rest. While others might find it easy to drift to the sound of late night infomercials, she needed silence, and she needed it now. 
Miffed, she shuffled off her blanket and left her bedroom, but stopped at the top of the stairs as a chill crawled through her skin. She stared down into a dark, silent bog on the first floor. No one was watching television. The busy voices sheâ€™d heard from her pillow were mute, as if they were never there to begin with. Confused, she turned on her heel and went back to her bed; and pulled the covers up over her nose.
