# Day 18: Grassy Hill
Cold breath streamed by my ear, and you whispered something only I could understand. Smiling, I shuffled up the grassy hill where our cherry blossom was covered in pink flowers. I asked if you remembered when we planted this tree, the day our first granddaughter was born. That was ten years ago now, and it has taken me another five to muster the strength to climb again. Iâ€™d avoided this place for so long, afraid of the pain it might cause me to stand here alone. Now that your spirit had long soaked into the roots, your presence was stronger than it'd ever been, and I could see you in the blooms as they flew in the wind around me.
