# Day 10: Bridge
In the twilight of dawn, halfway through a route as familiar as home, I stood frozen at the approach. My pulse still raced from running the last two miles, even as I took a slow step forward. The air weighed on me, every footfall sunk to the pavement the closer I came to the midpoint. Bracing, I summoned the courage to glance at the spot you last stood. And there, your shadow was looking over the twinkling waves of traffic, one hundred feet below. Thump—my heart lodged in my throat. I diverted my brimming eyes, and sprinted as if passing a midnight stranger. I pushed until I couldn’t feel, until your shadow fell away; running, panting, blindly to the other side. Once across, I skidded to a stop and dared a backward glance. Behind me was only emptiness, your shadow erased by the wind. With a slow breath, I turned to continue, hating that scar of a bridge.
