# Day 25: Light
The night was moonless, and I was hopelessly lost without its cast. I wandered through the dim ultraviolet trees blindly, knowing at any point, my life could end in the belly of some nocturnal beast. Trudging through the dark, I did the same job I’d done every night for the past month, but found it difficult without the moon. 
Then, as if my prayers were answered, a twinkling light appeared in the abyss as I scaled over a rocky ridge. Hopeful purpose flooded my senses. I glided down, following it as my new north star. Its brilliance, so promising. Clarity consumed me. Brighter it grew as I drew closer, and closer. I raced forward, diving into it as if flying through the closing gates of Heaven. 
Lightning shot through my body. An excruciating pain lasted the rest of my life as the light began to fade. The wind ripped through my wings as I fell to the porch in a fatal spin, to an endless field littered with the corpses of dead brothers. 
“Damn moths,” I heard a giant say, as coarse bristles swept me into my grave.
