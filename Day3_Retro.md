# Day 3: Retro
My father’s microwave outlived him. It sits now on my grout-tiled countertop, whirring steadily with my unmoving bowl inside. I stood by, watching it plaintively like a childhood movie. Amber light from the small door brightened my otherwise cold, twilit kitchen. He hadn’t been a wealthy man, my father, but he was jovial, kept me out of his stressors, and fed me microwave macaroni and cheese. Debt caught up to him in the end, and this was the only thing his creditors left of him; this enduring appliance from ‘85. On its narrow LCD, glowing numbers counted down to ‘End’, and it chirped like a baby bird. Popping it open, I took out the bowl of macaroni and cheese, assuaged by the familiar aroma, warmth, and promise of a full belly.
