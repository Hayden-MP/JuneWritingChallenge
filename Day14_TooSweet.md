# Day 14: Too Sweet
She was spreading cream cheese frosting on a batch of fresh red velvet cupcakes when Jordan came home from the bus stop. “Jordan, honey,” she said with a guilty smile. “How was school?” 
Out of the December cold, he entered the warm, sweet air of the apartment and shut the door. “Fine.”
She held up a plate stacked with four freshly-frosted cupcakes. “Look what I made!”
Jordan glanced at her. “Cool,” he said, monotonically, and slipped his backpack from his shoulder. 
Her face dropped as she set the plate back on the counter. What a coincidence that she made cupcakes today. With no intention of indulging her ingratiation, he turned into the house toward his room. She called out after him, “Wait, Jordan.” 
He stopped and shrugged at her. “What?”
“Are you still mad—”
“Seriously, Mom?” he said abruptly. “What do you think?”
She sighed. “I’m not perfect, you know.”
“You make that pretty obvious.”
She put a fist on her hip in that laughable way she thought was authoritative. “You know how hard it is doing this alone?”
“I ask for your help one time. I had to walk across town in the middle of the night, Mom. And I come home to you passed out on the couch, knowing I was out there, like you wouldn’t even care if your own son got jumped. The one time I try to ask for help and you can’t even get your shit together.”
“Language, Jordan.” She stepped up to him like a bowling ball toward a pin, tucked her chin into his chest and wrapped her thick arms around his torso. Her breath smelled of ethanol already. Ethanol and sugar. “I’m only human, okay? I make mistakes.” That didn’t sound like an apology.
She released him and wicked away a tear with her thumb. “Here,” she said after a sniffle, and took a frosted cupcake from the platter. “At least try a bite.” Jordan rolled his eyes. She held it out for him. “I made them from scratch just for you.” Jordan took the cupcake, lifted it to his lips and sunk his teeth into the spongy cake and cream cheese. He chewed, grimaced, then handed it back to her. “What’s wrong with it?” she asked.
He swallowed, begrudgingly. “Too sweet.”
