# Day 6: Freedom
Crows flocked to cages dangling from a fruitful tree. Did it matter how piles of seed and fruit appeared inside? The crows came and went, made nests, raised young, until the barred doors swung and latched. Disquieted, the crows stirred, but feeding quelled their fear. Time passed, young now overgrown, tensions rose and feathers plucked. Floors polluted with waste. When the doors reopened, a flurry of those who remembered the sky leapt from its confines and struggled with their weakened wings. Of the cage-born, obese and flightless, they stared at freedom and knew not what to do with it. So they remained, and locked inside once again.
