# Day 12: Age
My engine sputtered just as the last light of day sunk over the mountains. It’s been ready to give up for a while, but I manage to keep it running like an old quarter horse, with a little extra attention and love. After its final breath, it spat me out at the crossroads of somewhere and nowhere. There was pavement at some point, I remember that. 
Flipping the kickstand down into the dirt, I raised my leg over the saddle. Standing before the empty desertscape, I started opposite of my tracks.
I wandered ‘til the sky turned pale. I wandered ‘til the last two days without water caught up to me. Wheezing in the dust, my head throbbing with each step, I coughed blood, but had nothing left to spit with. A lifetime of freedom, this is what it tasted like. My legs trembled and collapsed all the same. I stared past the horizon on my knees, and in those final hours, I saw flowers blooming with bees, an arrow of geese pointed south, and breaking through a distant sky, the sun was rising again.
