# Day 27: Speed (actually a snippet from my second book!)
He leaned forward and gripped the steering wheel, moving his right foot to the acceleration pedal. Tears brimmed over his eyes as he pressed down the toe of his boot, taking the car out of autodrive and into manual. Puttering squeaks came form the faux leather of the wheel cover as he wrung it tightly under his knuckles. The speedometer on the dashboard ticked up to one hundred kilometers per hour, then one-fifty, one-ninety. Flying down, stalks of bamboo flanking the road blurred into solid blocks. He gritted his teeth and held back a sob. Two-ten. He remembered Erika, bloodied and stiff. Two-twenty. Ben, running into the wildfire, his screams ringing his ears. Two-forty. Miley, unconscious in the dirt, her clothes cut to shreds with a knife.
There she was in the road, her pale body laid out in the center, and he was speeding toward it like a heat-seeking missile. Sucking in a breath, he slammed his foot down on the brake. The truck skidded in a squeal, losing traction as he spun in circles. He cursed, his shoulders bouncing around between the door and the console, and tried to regain control over the wheel. By some miracle, he missed the body and stopped with a lurch to the side of the road. 
He quickly unclipped his belt, opened the door, and fell out on his side with a grunt. The body glowed red in the truck's rear tail lights, and he scrambled over on his hands and knee like a wounded animal. But as its shape came into focus, the edges defined, not a body, but folds and ridges. It was a translucent white tarp, and he pinched the end, lifting it up as a cool draft filled it like a sail to find nothing underneath.
He sat there in the middle of the street in a daze. Head swimming, heart pounding with adrenaline. Continuous breeze tousled his grown-out hair and clung to his wet cheeks. He wiped the tip of his nose with the back of his hand, then coughed and rolled over to push himself up on one foot. Hopping back to the truck, falling over twice, he slammed his hands over the edge of the frame to keep steady, and dragged himself back to the driver's seat.
